# chrome_launcher

Android Flutter Plugin to force launch an URL with Google Chrome.

## Background (Why?)

Some pre-installed browsers didn't execute Deep Links/App Links that I designated, but Chrome did. To enforce, the usage of Chrome, then I made this.

## Getting Started

Pretty straightforward.

Launch an URL with Google Chrome on Android devices. Also provides utility method to check if Chrome for Android is installed.
